When the plane slices the sphere, the intersection of the two is a circle. Try moving the plane around now. When the two intersect, you will be able to see a circle which is the intersection. As you move the plane, you can see the circle growing and shrinking. When the plane is at the middle of the sphere, the circle is as large as the sphere is. When the plane doesn't pass through the sphere, there is no intersection, and you can't see the circle. Next, let's try this in 4 dimensions. Click on the 'Intro to 4D' button to continue."
