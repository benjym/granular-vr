      "text": "Welcome to hyperspace. You're now in a four dimensional box. Flying around you are four dimensional hyperspheres. You can move around in the first three dimensions with the joysticks on your hand controllers. To move in the fourth dimension you can push the right joystick up and down. The middle of the room is white, and the ends are red or blue. I'm going to take you on a journey where you will learn what 4D space is, and how to play a game of 4D pool. To get you there, we will start by learning what all of these dimensions are. You can move onto the next module by pointing one of your controllers at the button that says 'Intro to 2D' and pulling the trigger."
