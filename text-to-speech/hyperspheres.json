    "text": "In front of you are three hyperspheres. On the right is a three dimensional hypersphere. This is just a regular sphere. Every point on the surface of the sphere is a distance r from its centre. To the left of this is a circle. Again, every point on the edge of this circle is a distance r from its centre. On the left is a one dimensional hypersphere, which is just a line of length two r. Can you imagine what a four dimensional hypersphere might be like? Let's continue and start to learn about higher dimensional spheres. Click on the Slicing space button when you're ready."
